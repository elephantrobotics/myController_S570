# I. Simulation

We provide some **static simulations** and **dynamic simulations** to interact with the MyController S570.

## 1.1 Static Simulation
Static simulation here refers to interacting with the MyController S570 in the simulation using the sliding module in rviz.

To do this, open a terminal in the workspace and enter the following commands:
> source devel/setup.bash # Add environment variables  
> roslaunch myarm_m test02.launch  

**This will also open rviz and generate the simulation model of MyController S570.**

## 1.2 Dynamic Simulation
